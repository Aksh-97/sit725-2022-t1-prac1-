          <p> As a web developer and software engineer, I'd like to broaden my knowledge and put my talents to the test in the areas of design and digital marketing. My ultimate goal is to create a website that is secure, efficient, and attracts visitors for the best marketing results</p>
          <ui>
            <li> The web developer works with internet-based technologies, while the software engineer focuses on operating systems. </li>
            <li>As a perfect employee, I would take the necessary steps in the coding and programming process to reduce internet traffic, increase maintenance, and provide troubleshooting updates</li>
            <li>As a rookie, I may have challenges in achieving the greatest achievements in my line of employment. However, I will work tirelessly to achieve the greatest possible outcome.</li>
